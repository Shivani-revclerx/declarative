## Steps We Followed

Below are the steps we followed to create and push our project to GitHub, and prepare it for use in a Jenkins freestyle job:

### 1. Created the Project Locally
- Created a file named `index.html`
- Added a basic HTML structure describing the freestyle job

### 2. Initialized Git and Created a GitHub Repository
- Opened terminal and ran:
  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit with index.html"
